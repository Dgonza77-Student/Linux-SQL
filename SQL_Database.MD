# Creating and Managing a Healthcare Database in SQL Server

## Objective

In this lab, the goal is to create and manage a simple healthcare database using SQL commands within Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). You will create five tables—Patient, Test, Treatment, Personnel, and Bed—and populate them with sample data. This lab emphasizes the use of SQL commands for table creation and data manipulation rather than the table designer tool in SSMS.

### Skills Learned
- Creating tables using SQL `CREATE TABLE` commands.
- Inserting data into tables using `INSERT INTO`.
- Querying data using `SELECT * FROM`.
- Understanding data types, constraints, and attributes in SQL.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- SQL Developer Server
- SQL commands: `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`
